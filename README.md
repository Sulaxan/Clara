# Clara
*This is more formally known as Project Clara - naming note below*

This project is no longer actively worked on!

An experimental MC plugin to add in a RPG-like experience into the game. Adds in custom:
- World generation
- Items
- Armour
- Entities
- Bosses
- and more!

The project also adds in a custom load/save player data mechanism.

It is important to note that this project is **experimental**. A lot of the components should work as intended,
but there no guarantees. This project should rather serve as a reference for future projects rather than be built
on top of (but feel free to do that if you'd like!). 

For the curious minded who want to mess around with the project, the plugin is for **1.8.8** (though it should most
likely work for any 1.8.x verison, but again, there are no guarantees).

## Why Clara?
I have no clue, just a name that came to mind - the name wasn't going to be the official name for the project 
and was going to change when a better name was found, but that never came around, and so the project was known
as Project Clara (or, simply, Clara)!
